Mind observing is part of chinese teaching of zen. It means to focus on just mind and mindful thoughts during the process of meditation.
This blog wont go that deep in theory of mediation and zen but focus on empowering readers life and trying to help with living a more fulfilling life.
I am not, repeat NOT a life coach, guru, monk or any kind of professional. I am just someone who think that writing this will help at least one reader in what ever way possible and i believe that writing this particular blog will help me to be more accountable for actions done in my life.
My intention is to write about habits, mindfulness, healthy living and everything that i consider helpful for you. I will write short personal thoughts and i will try to do good job, for you, my readers.
